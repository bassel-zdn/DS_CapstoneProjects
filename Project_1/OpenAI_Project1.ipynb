Unlike recent language repre\\x02sentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad\\x02ford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre\\x02train deep bidirectional representations from\\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re\\x02sult, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine\\x02tuned with just one additional output layer\\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\\nlanguage inference, without substantial task\\x02specific architecture modifications.\\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re\\x02sults on eleven natural language processing\\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer\\x02ing Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im\\x02provement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\\n1 Introduction\\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\\nbe effective for improving many natural language\\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re\\x02lationships between sentences by analyzing them\\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\\nwhere models are required to produce fine-grained\\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\\nThere are two existing strategies for apply\\x02ing pre-trained language representations to down\\x02stream tasks: feature-based and fine-tuning. The\\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\\net al., 2018a), uses task-specific architectures that\\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi\\x02tional features. The fine-tuning approach, such as\\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\\ntask-specific parameters, and is trained on the\\ndownstream tasks by simply fine-tuning all pre\\x02trained parameters. The two approaches share the\\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\\ngeneral language representations.\\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe\\x02cially for the fine-tuning approaches. The ma\\x02jor limitation is that standard language models are\\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi\\x02tectures that can be used during pre-training. For\\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to\\x02right architecture, where every token can only at\\x02tend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re\\x02strictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\\nand could be very harmful when applying fine\\x02tuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor\\x02porate context from both directions.\\nIn this paper, we improve the fine-tuning based\\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\\nEncoder Representations from Transformers.\\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi\\x02rectionality constraint by using a “masked lan\\x02guage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in\\x02spired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The\\nmasked language model randomly masks some of\\nthe tokens from the input, and the objective is to\\npredict the original vocabulary id of the masked\\n'),\n",

Unlike left-to\\x02right language model pre-training, the MLM ob\\x02jective enables the representation to fuse the left\\nand the right context, which allows us to pre\\x02train a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addi\\x02tion to the masked language model, we also use\\na “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre\\x02trains text-pair representations. The contributions\\nof our paper are as follows:\\n• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\\npre-training for language representations. Un\\x02like Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec\\x02tional language models for pre-training, BERT\\nuses masked language models to enable pre\\x02trained deep bidirectional representations. This\\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\\n• We show that pre-trained representations reduce\\nthe need for many heavily-engineered task\\x02specific architectures. BERT is the first fine\\x02tuning based representation model that achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance on a large suite\\nof sentence-level and token-level tasks, outper\\x02forming many task-specific architectures.\\n• BERT advances the state of the art for eleven\\nNLP tasks. The code and pre-trained mod\\x02els are available at https://github.com/\\ngoogle-research/bert.\\n2 Related Work\\nThere is a long history of pre-training general lan\\x02guage representations, and we briefly review the\\nmost widely-used approaches in this section.\\n2.1 Unsupervised Feature-based Approaches\\nLearning widely applicable representations of\\nwords has been an active area of research for\\ndecades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992;\\nAndo and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and\\nneural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,\\n2014) methods. Pre-trained word embeddings\\nare an integral part of modern NLP systems, of\\x02fering significant improvements over embeddings\\nlearned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pre\\x02train word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan\\x02guage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih\\nand Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis\\x02criminate correct from incorrect words in left and\\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).\\nThese approaches have been generalized to\\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embed\\x02dings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,\\n2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,\\n2014). To train sentence representations, prior\\nwork has used objectives to rank candidate next\\nsentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and\\nLee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen\\x02tence words given a representation of the previous\\nsentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto\\x02encoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,\\n2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re\\x02search along a different dimension. They extract\\ncontext-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a\\nright-to-left language model. The contextual rep\\x02resentation of each token is the concatenation of\\nthe left-to-right and right-to-left representations.\\nWhen integrating contextual word embeddings\\nwith existing task-specific architectures, ELMo\\nadvances the state of the art for several major NLP\\nbenchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques\\x02tion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment\\nanalysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity\\nrecognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,\\n2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning\\ncontextual representations through a task to pre\\x02dict a single word from both left and right context\\nusing LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is\\nfeature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus\\net al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used\\nto improve the robustness of text generation mod\\x02els.\\n2.2 Unsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches\\nAs with the feature-based approaches, the first\\nworks in this direction only pre-trained word em\\x02bedding parameters from unlabeled text (Col\\x02lobert and Weston, 2008).\\nMore recently, sentence or document encoders\\nwhich produce contextual token representations\\nhave been pre-trained from unlabeled text and\\nfine-tuned for a supervised downstream task (Dai\\nand Le, 2015; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford\\net al., 2018). The advantage of these approaches\\nis that few parameters need to be learned from\\nscratch. At least partly due to this advantage,\\nOpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018) achieved pre\\x02viously state-of-the-art results on many sentence\\x02level tasks from the GLUE benchmark (Wang\\net al., 2018a).

There are two steps in our\\nframework: pre-training and fine-tuning. Dur\\x02ing pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For fine\\x02tuning, the BERT model is first initialized with\\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param\\x02eters are fine-tuned using labeled data from the\\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep\\x02arate fine-tuned models, even though they are ini\\x02tialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\\nas a running example for this section.\\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its unified ar\\x02chitecture across different tasks. There is mini\\x02mal difference between the pre-trained architec\\x02ture and the final downstream architecture.\\nModel Architecture BERT’s model architec\\x02ture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en\\x02coder based on the original implementation de\\x02scribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\\nthe tensor2tensor library.1 Because the use\\nof Transformers has become common and our im\\x02plementation is almost identical to the original,\\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip\\x02tion of the model architecture and refer readers to\\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\\nsuch as “The Annotated Transformer.”2\\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\\nH, and the number of self-attention heads as A.\\n3\\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\\nBERTBASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param\\x02eters=110M) and BERTLARGE (L=24, H=1024,\\nA=16, Total Parameters=340M).\\nBERTBASE was chosen to have the same model\\nsize as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.\\nCritically, however, the BERT Transformer uses\\nbidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Trans\\x02former uses constrained self-attention where every\\ntoken can only attend to context to its left.4\\n1\\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor\\n2\\nhttp://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html\\n3\\nIn all cases we set the feed-forward/filter size to be 4H,\\ni.e., 3072 for the H = 768 and 4096 for the H = 1024.\\n4We note that in the literature the bidirectional Trans-\\n'),\n",

A “sequence” refers to the in\\x02put token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin\\x02gle sentence or two sentences packed together.\\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The first\\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas\\x02sification token ([CLS]). The final hidden state\\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag\\x02gregate sequence representation for classification\\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\\ntoken ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embed\\x02ding to every token indicating whether it belongs\\nto sentence A or sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\\nwe denote input embedding as E, the final hidden\\nvector of the special [CLS] token as C ∈ R\\nH,\\nand the final hidden vector for the i\\nth input token\\nas Ti ∈ R\\nH.\\nFor a given token, its input representation is\\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\\nsegment, and position embeddings. A visualiza\\x02tion of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\\n3.1 Pre-training BERT\\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.\\n(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or\\nright-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.\\nInstead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper\\x02vised tasks, described in this section. This step\\nis presented in the left part of Figure 1.\\nTask #1: Masked LM Intuitively, it is reason\\x02able to believe that a deep bidirectional model is\\nstrictly more powerful than either a left-to-right\\nmodel or the shallow concatenation of a left-to\\x02right and a right-to-left model. Unfortunately,\\nstandard conditional language models can only be\\ntrained left-to-right or right-to-left, since bidirec\\x02tional conditioning would allow each word to in\\x02directly “see itself”, and the model could trivially\\npredict the target word in a multi-layered context.\\nformer is often referred to as a “Transformer encoder” while\\nthe left-context-only version is referred to as a “Transformer\\ndecoder” since it can be used for text generation.\\nIn order to train a deep bidirectional representa\\x02tion, we simply mask some percentage of the input\\ntokens at random, and then predict those masked\\ntokens. We refer to this procedure as a “masked\\nLM” (MLM), although it is often referred to as a\\nCloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this\\ncase, the final hidden vectors corresponding to the\\nmask tokens are fed into an output softmax over\\nthe vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our\\nexperiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece to\\x02kens in each sequence at random. In contrast to\\ndenoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we\\nonly predict the masked words rather than recon\\x02structing the entire input.\\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirec\\x02tional pre-trained model, a downside is that we\\nare creating a mismatch between pre-training and\\nfine-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap\\x02pear during fine-tuning. To mitigate this, we do\\nnot always replace “masked” words with the ac\\x02tual [MASK] token. The training data generator\\nchooses 15% of the token positions at random for\\nprediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace\\nthe i-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of\\nthe time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)\\nthe unchanged i-th token 10% of the time. Then,\\nTi will be used to predict the original token with\\ncross entropy loss. We compare variations of this\\nprocedure in Appendix C.2.\\nTask #2: Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)\\nMany important downstream tasks such as Ques\\x02tion Answering (QA) and Natural Language Infer\\x02ence (NLI) are based on understanding the rela\\x02tionship between two sentences, which is not di\\x02rectly captured by language modeling. In order\\nto train a model that understands sentence rela\\x02tionships, we pre-train for a binarized next sen\\x02tence prediction task that can be trivially gener\\x02ated from any monolingual corpus. Specifically,\\nwhen choosing the sentences A and B for each pre\\x02training example, 50% of the time B is the actual\\nnext sentence that follows A (labeled as IsNext),\\nand 50% of the time it is a random sentence from\\nthe corpus (labeled as NotNext). As we show\\nin Figure 1, C is used for next sentence predic\\x02tion (NSP).5 Despite its simplicity, we demon\\x02strate in Section 5.1 that pre-training towards this\\ntask is very beneficial to both QA and NLI. 6\\n5The final model achieves 97%-98% accuracy on NSP.\\n6The vector C is not a meaningful sentence representation\\nwithout fine-tuning, since it was trained with NSP.\\n'),\n",

The input embeddings are the sum of the token embeddings, the segmenta\\x02tion embeddings and the position embeddings.\\nThe NSP task is closely related to representation\\x02learning objectives used in Jernite et al. (2017) and\\nLogeswaran and Lee (2018). However, in prior\\nwork, only sentence embeddings are transferred to\\ndown-stream tasks, where BERT transfers all pa\\x02rameters to initialize end-task model parameters.\\nPre-training data The pre-training procedure\\nlargely follows the existing literature on language\\nmodel pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we\\nuse the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al.,\\n2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).\\nFor Wikipedia we extract only the text passages\\nand ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is criti\\x02cal to use a document-level corpus rather than a\\nshuffled sentence-level corpus such as the Billion\\nWord Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to\\nextract long contiguous sequences.\\n3.2 Fine-tuning BERT\\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the self\\x02attention mechanism in the Transformer al\\x02lows BERT to model many downstream tasks—\\nwhether they involve single text or text pairs—by\\nswapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common\\npattern is to independently encode text pairs be\\x02fore applying bidirectional cross attention, such\\nas Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi\\x02rectional cross attention between two sentences.\\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task\\x02specific inputs and outputs into BERT and fine\\x02tune all the parameters end-to-end. At the in\\x02put, sentence A and sentence B from pre-training\\nare analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphras\\x02ing, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)\\nquestion-passage pairs in question answering, and\\n(4) a degenerate text-∅ pair in text classification\\nor sequence tagging. At the output, the token rep\\x02resentations are fed into an output layer for token\\x02level tasks, such as sequence tagging or question\\nanswering, and the [CLS] representation is fed\\ninto an output layer for classification, such as en\\x02tailment or sentiment analysis.\\nCompared to pre-training, fine-tuning is rela\\x02tively inexpensive. All of the results in the pa\\x02per can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a sin\\x02gle Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting\\nfrom the exact same pre-trained model.7 We de\\x02scribe the task-specific details in the correspond\\x02ing subsections of Section 4. More details can be\\nfound in Appendix A.5.\\n4 Experiments\\nIn this section, we present BERT fine-tuning re\\x02sults on 11 NLP tasks.\\n4.1 GLUE\\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation\\n(GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a col\\x02lection of diverse natural language understanding\\ntasks. Detailed descriptions of GLUE datasets are\\nincluded in Appendix B.1.\\nTo fine-tune on GLUE, we represent the input\\nsequence (for single sentence or sentence pairs)\\nas described in Section 3, and use the final hid\\x02den vector C ∈ R\\nH corresponding to the first\\ninput token ([CLS]) as the aggregate representa\\x02tion.

The left-only constraint\\nwas also applied at fine-tuning, because removing\\nit introduced a pre-train/fine-tune mismatch that\\ndegraded downstream performance. Additionally,\\nthis model was pre-trained without the NSP task.\\nThis is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but\\nusing our larger training dataset, our input repre\\x02sentation, and our fine-tuning scheme.\\nWe first examine the impact brought by the NSP\\ntask. In Table 5, we show that removing NSP\\nhurts performance significantly on QNLI, MNLI,\\nand SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact\\nof training bidirectional representations by com\\x02paring “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”. The LTR\\nmodel performs worse than the MLM model on all\\ntasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR\\nmodel will perform poorly at token predictions,\\nsince the token-level hidden states have no right\\x02side context. In order to make a good faith at\\x02tempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added\\na randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does\\nsignificantly improve results on SQuAD, but the\\nresults are still far worse than those of the pre\\x02trained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts\\nperformance on the GLUE tasks.\\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to\\ntrain separate LTR and RTL models and represent\\neach token as the concatenation of the two mod\\x02els, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as\\nexpensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this\\nis non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL\\nmodel would not be able to condition the answer\\non the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful\\nthan a deep bidirectional model, since it can use\\nboth left and right context at every layer.\\n5.2 Effect of Model Size\\nIn this section, we explore the effect of model size\\non fine-tuning task accuracy. We trained a number\\nof BERT models with a differing number of layers,\\nhidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise\\nusing the same hyperparameters and training pro\\x02cedure as described previously.\\nResults on selected GLUE tasks are shown in\\nTable 6. In this table, we report the average Dev\\nSet accuracy from 5 random restarts of fine-tuning.\\nWe can see that larger models lead to a strict ac\\x02curacy improvement across all four datasets, even\\nfor MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled train\\x02ing examples, and is substantially different from\\nthe pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surpris\\x02ing that we are able to achieve such significant\\nimprovements on top of models which are al\\x02ready quite large relative to the existing literature.\\nFor example, the largest Transformer explored in\\nVaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16)\\nwith 100M parameters for the encoder, and the\\nlargest Transformer we have found in the literature\\nis (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters\\n(Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERTBASE\\ncontains 110M parameters and BERTLARGE con\\x02tains 340M parameters.\\nIt has long been known that increasing the\\nmodel size will lead to continual improvements\\non large-scale tasks such as machine translation\\nand language modeling, which is demonstrated\\nby the LM perplexity of held-out training data\\nshown in Table 6. However, we believe that\\nthis is the first work to demonstrate convinc\\x02ingly that scaling to extreme model sizes also\\nleads to large improvements on very small scale\\ntasks, provided that the model has been suffi\\x02ciently pre-trained.

(2016) men\\x02tioned in passing that increasing hidden dimen\\x02sion size from 200 to 600 helped, but increasing\\nfurther to 1,000 did not bring further improve\\x02ments. Both of these prior works used a feature\\x02based approach — we hypothesize that when the\\nmodel is fine-tuned directly on the downstream\\ntasks and uses only a very small number of ran\\x02domly initialized additional parameters, the task\\x02specific models can benefit from the larger, more\\nexpressive pre-trained representations even when\\ndownstream task data is very small.\\n5.3 Feature-based Approach with BERT\\nAll of the BERT results presented so far have used\\nthe fine-tuning approach, where a simple classifi\\x02cation layer is added to the pre-trained model, and\\nall parameters are jointly fine-tuned on a down\\x02stream task. However, the feature-based approach,\\nwhere fixed features are extracted from the pre\\x02trained model, has certain advantages. First, not\\nall tasks can be easily represented by a Trans\\x02former encoder architecture, and therefore require\\na task-specific model architecture to be added.\\nSecond, there are major computational benefits\\nto pre-compute an expensive representation of the\\ntraining data once and then run many experiments\\nwith cheaper models on top of this representation.\\nIn this section, we compare the two approaches\\nby applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named\\nEntity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang\\nand De Meulder, 2003). In the input to BERT, we\\nuse a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we\\ninclude the maximal document context provided\\nby the data.

We use the representation of\\nthe first sub-token as the input to the token-level\\nclassifier over the NER label set.\\nTo ablate the fine-tuning approach, we apply the\\nfeature-based approach by extracting the activa\\x02tions from one or more layers without fine-tuning\\nany parameters of BERT. These contextual em\\x02beddings are used as input to a randomly initial\\x02ized two-layer 768-dimensional BiLSTM before\\nthe classification layer.\\nResults are presented in Table 7.

In\\nparticular, these results enable even low-resource\\ntasks to benefit from deep unidirectional architec\\x02tures. Our major contribution is further general\\x02izing these findings to deep bidirectional architec\\x02tures, allowing the same pre-trained model to suc\\x02cessfully tackle a broad set of NLP tasks.\\n'),\n",

The purpose of this is to bias the\\nrepresentation towards the actual observed\\nword.\\nThe advantage of this procedure is that the\\nTransformer encoder does not know which words\\nit will be asked to predict or which have been re\\x02placed by random words, so it is forced to keep\\na distributional contextual representation of ev\\x02ery input token. Additionally, because random\\nreplacement only occurs for 1.5% of all tokens\\n(i.e., 10% of 15%), this does not seem to harm\\nthe model’s language understanding capability. In\\nSection C.2, we evaluate the impact this proce\\x02dure.\\nCompared to standard langauge model training,\\nthe masked LM only make predictions on 15% of\\ntokens in each batch, which suggests that more\\npre-training steps may be required for the model\\n'),\n",

The first sentence receives the A\\nembedding and the second receives the B embed\\x02ding. 50% of the time B is the actual next sentence\\nthat follows A and 50% of the time it is a random\\nsentence, which is done for the “next sentence pre\\x02diction” task. They are sampled such that the com\\x02bined length is ≤ 512 tokens. The LM masking is\\napplied after WordPiece tokenization with a uni\\x02form masking rate of 15%, and no special consid\\x02eration given to partial word pieces.\\nWe train with batch size of 256 sequences (256\\nsequences * 512 tokens = 128,000 tokens/batch)\\nfor 1,000,000 steps, which is approximately 40\\nepochs over the 3.3 billion word corpus. We\\nuse Adam with learning rate of 1e-4, β1 = 0.9,\\nβ2 = 0.999, L2 weight decay of 0.01, learning\\nrate warmup over the first 10,000 steps, and linear\\ndecay of the learning rate. We use a dropout prob\\x02ability of 0.1 on all layers. We use a gelu acti\\x02vation (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016) rather than\\nthe standard relu, following OpenAI GPT. The\\ntraining loss is the sum of the mean masked LM\\nlikelihood and the mean next sentence prediction\\nlikelihood.\\nTraining of BERTBASE was performed on 4\\nCloud TPUs in Pod configuration (16 TPU chips\\ntotal).13 Training of BERTLARGE was performed\\non 16 Cloud TPUs (64 TPU chips total). Each pre\\x02training took 4 days to complete.\\nLonger sequences are disproportionately expen\\x02sive because attention is quadratic to the sequence\\nlength. To speed up pretraing in our experiments,\\nwe pre-train the model with sequence length of\\n128 for 90% of the steps. Then, we train the rest\\n10% of the steps of sequence of 512 to learn the\\npositional embeddings.\\nA.3 Fine-tuning Procedure\\nFor fine-tuning, most model hyperparameters are\\nthe same as in pre-training, with the exception of\\nthe batch size, learning rate, and number of train\\x02ing epochs. The dropout probability was always\\nkept at 0.1. The optimal hyperparameter values\\nare task-specific, but we found the following range\\nof possible values to work well across all tasks:\\n• Batch size: 16, 32\\n13https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/06/Cloud\\x02TPU-now-offers-preemptible-pricing-and-global\\x02availability.html\\n'),\n",

The comparisons be\\x02tween the model architectures are shown visually\\nin Figure 3. Note that in addition to the architec\\x02ture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are fine\\x02tuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based\\napproach.\\nThe most comparable existing pre-training\\nmethod to BERT is OpenAI GPT, which trains a\\nleft-to-right Transformer LM on a large text cor\\x02pus. In fact, many of the design decisions in BERT\\nwere intentionally made to make it as close to\\nGPT as possible so that the two methods could be\\nminimally compared. The core argument of this\\nwork is that the bi-directionality and the two pre\\x02training tasks presented in Section 3.1 account for\\nthe majority of the empirical improvements, but\\nwe do note that there are several other differences\\nbetween how BERT and GPT were trained:\\n• GPT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M\\nwords); BERT is trained on the BooksCor\\x02pus (800M words) and Wikipedia (2,500M\\nwords).\\n• GPT uses a sentence separator ([SEP]) and\\nclassifier token ([CLS]) which are only in\\x02troduced at fine-tuning time; BERT learns\\n[SEP], [CLS] and sentence A/B embed\\x02dings during pre-training.\\n• GPT was trained for 1M steps with a batch\\nsize of 32,000 words; BERT was trained for\\n1M steps with a batch size of 128,000 words.\\n• GPT used the same learning rate of 5e-5 for\\nall fine-tuning experiments; BERT chooses a\\ntask-specific fine-tuning learning rate which\\nperforms the best on the development set.\\nTo isolate the effect of these differences, we per\\x02form ablation experiments in Section 5.1 which\\ndemonstrate that the majority of the improvements\\nare in fact coming from the two pre-training tasks\\nand the bidirectionality they enable.\\nA.5 Illustrations of Fine-tuning on Different\\nTasks\\nThe illustration of fine-tuning BERT on different\\ntasks can be seen in Figure 4. Our task-specific\\nmodels are formed by incorporating BERT with\\none additional output layer, so a minimal num\\x02ber of parameters need to be learned from scratch.\\nAmong the tasks, (a) and (b) are sequence-level\\ntasks while (c) and (d) are token-level tasks.

Unlike recent language repre\\x02sentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad\\x02ford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre\\x02train deep bidirectional representations from\\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re\\x02sult, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine\\x02tuned with just one additional output layer\\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\\nlanguage inference, without substantial task\\x02specific architecture modifications.\\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re\\x02sults on eleven natural language processing\\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer\\x02ing Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im\\x02provement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\\n1 Introduction\\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\\nbe effective for improving many natural language\\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re\\x02lationships between sentences by analyzing them\\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\\nwhere models are required to produce fine-grained\\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\\nThere are two existing strategies for apply\\x02ing pre-trained language representations to down\\x02stream tasks: feature-based and fine-tuning. The\\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\\net al., 2018a), uses task-specific architectures that\\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi\\x02tional features. The fine-tuning approach, such as\\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\\ntask-specific parameters, and is trained on the\\ndownstream tasks by simply fine-tuning all pre\\x02trained parameters. The two approaches share the\\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\\ngeneral language representations.\\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe\\x02cially for the fine-tuning approaches. The ma\\x02jor limitation is that standard language models are\\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi\\x02tectures that can be used during pre-training. For\\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to\\x02right architecture, where every token can only at\\x02tend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re\\x02strictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\\nand could be very harmful when applying fine\\x02tuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor\\x02porate context from both directions.\\nIn this paper, we improve the fine-tuning based\\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\\nEncoder Representations from Transformers.\\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi\\x02rectionality constraint by using a “masked lan\\x02guage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in\\x02spired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The\\nmasked language model randomly masks some of\\nthe tokens from the input, and the objective is to\\npredict the original vocabulary id of the masked\\n'),\n",

Unlike left-to\\x02right language model pre-training, the MLM ob\\x02jective enables the representation to fuse the left\\nand the right context, which allows us to pre\\x02train a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addi\\x02tion to the masked language model, we also use\\na “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre\\x02trains text-pair representations. The contributions\\nof our paper are as follows:\\n• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\\npre-training for language representations. Un\\x02like Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec\\x02tional language models for pre-training, BERT\\nuses masked language models to enable pre\\x02trained deep bidirectional representations. This\\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\\n• We show that pre-trained representations reduce\\nthe need for many heavily-engineered task\\x02specific architectures. BERT is the first fine\\x02tuning based representation model that achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance on a large suite\\nof sentence-level and token-level tasks, outper\\x02forming many task-specific architectures.\\n• BERT advances the state of the art for eleven\\nNLP tasks. The code and pre-trained mod\\x02els are available at https://github.com/\\ngoogle-research/bert.\\n2 Related Work\\nThere is a long history of pre-training general lan\\x02guage representations, and we briefly review the\\nmost widely-used approaches in this section.\\n2.1 Unsupervised Feature-based Approaches\\nLearning widely applicable representations of\\nwords has been an active area of research for\\ndecades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992;\\nAndo and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and\\nneural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,\\n2014) methods. Pre-trained word embeddings\\nare an integral part of modern NLP systems, of\\x02fering significant improvements over embeddings\\nlearned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pre\\x02train word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan\\x02guage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih\\nand Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis\\x02criminate correct from incorrect words in left and\\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).\\nThese approaches have been generalized to\\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embed\\x02dings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,\\n2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,\\n2014). To train sentence representations, prior\\nwork has used objectives to rank candidate next\\nsentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and\\nLee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen\\x02tence words given a representation of the previous\\nsentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto\\x02encoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,\\n2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re\\x02search along a different dimension. They extract\\ncontext-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a\\nright-to-left language model. The contextual rep\\x02resentation of each token is the concatenation of\\nthe left-to-right and right-to-left representations.\\nWhen integrating contextual word embeddings\\nwith existing task-specific architectures, ELMo\\nadvances the state of the art for several major NLP\\nbenchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques\\x02tion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment\\nanalysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity\\nrecognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,\\n2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning\\ncontextual representations through a task to pre\\x02dict a single word from both left and right context\\nusing LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is\\nfeature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus\\net al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used\\nto improve the robustness of text generation mod\\x02els.\\n2.2 Unsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches\\nAs with the feature-based approaches, the first\\nworks in this direction only pre-trained word em\\x02bedding parameters from unlabeled text (Col\\x02lobert and Weston, 2008).\\nMore recently, sentence or document encoders\\nwhich produce contextual token representations\\nhave been pre-trained from unlabeled text and\\nfine-tuned for a supervised downstream task (Dai\\nand Le, 2015; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford\\net al., 2018). The advantage of these approaches\\nis that few parameters need to be learned from\\nscratch. At least partly due to this advantage,\\nOpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018) achieved pre\\x02viously state-of-the-art results on many sentence\\x02level tasks from the GLUE benchmark (Wang\\net al., 2018a).

[CLS] is a special\\nsymbol added in front of every input example, and [SEP] is a special separator token (e.g. separating ques\\x02tions/answers).\\ning and auto-encoder objectives have been used\\nfor pre-training such models (Howard and Ruder,\\n2018; Radford et al., 2018; Dai and Le, 2015).\\n2.3 Transfer Learning from Supervised Data\\nThere has also been work showing effective trans\\x02fer from supervised tasks with large datasets, such\\nas natural language inference (Conneau et al.,\\n2017) and machine translation (McCann et al.,\\n2017). Computer vision research has also demon\\x02strated the importance of transfer learning from\\nlarge pre-trained models, where an effective recipe\\nis to fine-tune models pre-trained with Ima\\x02geNet (Deng et al., 2009; Yosinski et al., 2014).\\n3 BERT\\nWe introduce BERT and its detailed implementa\\x02tion in this section. There are two steps in our\\nframework: pre-training and fine-tuning. Dur\\x02ing pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For fine\\x02tuning, the BERT model is first initialized with\\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param\\x02eters are fine-tuned using labeled data from the\\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep\\x02arate fine-tuned models, even though they are ini\\x02tialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\\nas a running example for this section.\\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its unified ar\\x02chitecture across different tasks. There is mini\\x02mal difference between the pre-trained architec\\x02ture and the final downstream architecture.\\nModel Architecture BERT’s model architec\\x02ture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en\\x02coder based on the original implementation de\\x02scribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\\nthe tensor2tensor library.1 Because the use\\nof Transformers has become common and our im\\x02plementation is almost identical to the original,\\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip\\x02tion of the model architecture and refer readers to\\nVaswani et al.

A “sequence” refers to the in\\x02put token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin\\x02gle sentence or two sentences packed together.\\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The first\\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas\\x02sification token ([CLS]). The final hidden state\\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag\\x02gregate sequence representation for classification\\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\\ntoken ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embed\\x02ding to every token indicating whether it belongs\\nto sentence A or sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\\nwe denote input embedding as E, the final hidden\\nvector of the special [CLS] token as C ∈ R\\nH,\\nand the final hidden vector for the i\\nth input token\\nas Ti ∈ R\\nH.\\nFor a given token, its input representation is\\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\\nsegment, and position embeddings. A visualiza\\x02tion of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\\n3.1 Pre-training BERT\\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.\\n(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or\\nright-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.\\nInstead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper\\x02vised tasks, described in this section. This step\\nis presented in the left part of Figure 1.\\nTask #1: Masked LM Intuitively, it is reason\\x02able to believe that a deep bidirectional model is\\nstrictly more powerful than either a left-to-right\\nmodel or the shallow concatenation of a left-to\\x02right and a right-to-left model. Unfortunately,\\nstandard conditional language models can only be\\ntrained left-to-right or right-to-left, since bidirec\\x02tional conditioning would allow each word to in\\x02directly “see itself”, and the model could trivially\\npredict the target word in a multi-layered context.\\nformer is often referred to as a “Transformer encoder” while\\nthe left-context-only version is referred to as a “Transformer\\ndecoder” since it can be used for text generation.\\nIn order to train a deep bidirectional representa\\x02tion, we simply mask some percentage of the input\\ntokens at random, and then predict those masked\\ntokens. We refer to this procedure as a “masked\\nLM” (MLM), although it is often referred to as a\\nCloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this\\ncase, the final hidden vectors corresponding to the\\nmask tokens are fed into an output softmax over\\nthe vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our\\nexperiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece to\\x02kens in each sequence at random. In contrast to\\ndenoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we\\nonly predict the masked words rather than recon\\x02structing the entire input.\\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirec\\x02tional pre-trained model, a downside is that we\\nare creating a mismatch between pre-training and\\nfine-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap\\x02pear during fine-tuning. To mitigate this, we do\\nnot always replace “masked” words with the ac\\x02tual [MASK] token. The training data generator\\nchooses 15% of the token positions at random for\\nprediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace\\nthe i-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of\\nthe time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)\\nthe unchanged i-th token 10% of the time. Then,\\nTi will be used to predict the original token with\\ncross entropy loss. We compare variations of this\\nprocedure in Appendix C.2.\\nTask #2: Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)\\nMany important downstream tasks such as Ques\\x02tion Answering (QA) and Natural Language Infer\\x02ence (NLI) are based on understanding the rela\\x02tionship between two sentences, which is not di\\x02rectly captured by language modeling. In order\\nto train a model that understands sentence rela\\x02tionships, we pre-train for a binarized next sen\\x02tence prediction task that can be trivially gener\\x02ated from any monolingual corpus. Specifically,\\nwhen choosing the sentences A and B for each pre\\x02training example, 50% of the time B is the actual\\nnext sentence that follows A (labeled as IsNext),\\nand 50% of the time it is a random sentence from\\nthe corpus (labeled as NotNext). As we show\\nin Figure 1, C is used for next sentence predic\\x02tion (NSP).5 Despite its simplicity, we demon\\x02strate in Section 5.1 that pre-training towards this\\ntask is very beneficial to both QA and NLI. 6\\n5The final model achieves 97%-98% accuracy on NSP.\\n6The vector C is not a meaningful sentence representation\\nwithout fine-tuning, since it was trained with NSP.\\n'),\n",

The input embeddings are the sum of the token embeddings, the segmenta\\x02tion embeddings and the position embeddings.\\nThe NSP task is closely related to representation\\x02learning objectives used in Jernite et al. (2017) and\\nLogeswaran and Lee (2018). However, in prior\\nwork, only sentence embeddings are transferred to\\ndown-stream tasks, where BERT transfers all pa\\x02rameters to initialize end-task model parameters.\\nPre-training data The pre-training procedure\\nlargely follows the existing literature on language\\nmodel pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we\\nuse the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al.,\\n2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).\\nFor Wikipedia we extract only the text passages\\nand ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is criti\\x02cal to use a document-level corpus rather than a\\nshuffled sentence-level corpus such as the Billion\\nWord Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to\\nextract long contiguous sequences.\\n3.2 Fine-tuning BERT\\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the self\\x02attention mechanism in the Transformer al\\x02lows BERT to model many downstream tasks—\\nwhether they involve single text or text pairs—by\\nswapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common\\npattern is to independently encode text pairs be\\x02fore applying bidirectional cross attention, such\\nas Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi\\x02rectional cross attention between two sentences.\\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task\\x02specific inputs and outputs into BERT and fine\\x02tune all the parameters end-to-end. At the in\\x02put, sentence A and sentence B from pre-training\\nare analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphras\\x02ing, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)\\nquestion-passage pairs in question answering, and\\n(4) a degenerate text-∅ pair in text classification\\nor sequence tagging. At the output, the token rep\\x02resentations are fed into an output layer for token\\x02level tasks, such as sequence tagging or question\\nanswering, and the [CLS] representation is fed\\ninto an output layer for classification, such as en\\x02tailment or sentiment analysis.\\nCompared to pre-training, fine-tuning is rela\\x02tively inexpensive. All of the results in the pa\\x02per can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a sin\\x02gle Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting\\nfrom the exact same pre-trained model.7 We de\\x02scribe the task-specific details in the correspond\\x02ing subsections of Section 4. More details can be\\nfound in Appendix A.5.\\n4 Experiments\\nIn this section, we present BERT fine-tuning re\\x02sults on 11 NLP tasks.\\n4.1 GLUE\\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation\\n(GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a col\\x02lection of diverse natural language understanding\\ntasks. Detailed descriptions of GLUE datasets are\\nincluded in Appendix B.1.\\nTo fine-tune on GLUE, we represent the input\\nsequence (for single sentence or sentence pairs)\\nas described in Section 3, and use the final hid\\x02den vector C ∈ R\\nH corresponding to the first\\ninput token ([CLS]) as the aggregate representa\\x02tion. The only new parameters introduced during\\nfine-tuning are classification layer weights W ∈\\nR\\nK×H, where K is the number of labels. We com\\x02pute a standard classification loss with C and W,\\ni.e., log(softmax(CWT)).\\n7\\nFor example, the BERT SQuAD model can be trained in\\naround 30 minutes on a single Cloud TPU to achieve a Dev\\nF1 score of 91.0%.\\n8\\nSee (10) in https://gluebenchmark.com/faq.\\n')]"

The document under review provides an in-depth exploration of various fine-tuning strategies for NER, particularly focusing on the impact of different masking techniques on model performance. The findings reveal that while fine-tuning generally enhances performance across multiple masking strategies, certain approaches present unique challenges and varying levels of effectiveness.\\n\\nOne of the primary strategies discussed is the MASK strategy, which involves obscuring parts of the input data to encourage the model to learn contextual relationships and improve its predictive capabilities. This strategy is particularly relevant in the context of pre-trained models like BERT, which utilize masked language modeling as a core component of their training. However, the document highlights that the MASK strategy poses significant challenges when applied to feature-based approaches in NER. Feature-based methods typically rely on predefined features extracted from the input data, and the MASK strategy can disrupt the integrity of these features, leading to suboptimal performance. This disruption occurs because the model may struggle to accurately interpret the context of masked entities, resulting in a decrease in the overall effectiveness of the NER system.\\n\\nIn contrast, the document evaluates the RND (Random) strategy, which involves randomly masking entities within the input data. The findings indicate that this strategy significantly underperforms compared to the proposed strategy, which presumably incorporates a more systematic and informed approach to masking. The RND strategy's lack of structure and reliance on randomness can lead to a failure in capturing the necessary contextual cues that are vital for accurate entity recognition. As a result, the performance metrics associated with the RND strategy fall short, underscoring the importance of a well-thought-out masking approach in fine-tuning NER models.\\n\\nThe proposed strategy, while not explicitly detailed in the summary, is implied to be more effective due to its structured approach to masking. This suggests that the proposed method likely incorporates insights from the data itself, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between entities and their contexts. By leveraging a more informed masking technique, the proposed strategy can enhance the model's ability to learn from the data, ultimately leading to improved performance in NER tasks.\\n\\nThe document emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate masking strategies when fine-tuning models for NER. It suggests that practitioners should carefully consider the implications of their chosen approach, as the effectiveness of fine-tuning can vary significantly based on the masking strategy employed.
